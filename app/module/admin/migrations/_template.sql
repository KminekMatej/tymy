-- UP:

-- DOWN:
-- commands that reverts updates from UP section shall be written here:

CALL 'Migrations DOWN are for security reasons temporarily DISABLED. Impossible to migrate down from _MIGRATION_, in file _NEWFILE_';

-- DOWN migrations are disabled for security reasons.
-- These migrations might often include removal of some existent database columns, which is very dangerous to do on production servers.
-- Whenever we would migrate DOWN, then it would be impossible to migrate UP again, without loss of data.
